        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>As a driven computer science major in my final year with a 3.8 GPA, consistently making the Dean's List, I am seeking a software engineering internship where I can apply my passion for IT and robust technical skills. My education and hands-on experience in software development and cybersecurity have equipped me with the ability to solve complex problems and enhance operational efficiency. My GitHub portfolio demonstrates my proficiency in developing practical IT solutions, ranging from ticketing systems to automated network setups to a simple ML learning project I am working on and basic websites. Eager to contribute to a dynamic team, I am committed to leveraging my analytical and critical thinking abilities to drive innovation and success in a software engineering role.</p>

                <strong>SocioPedia:</strong> SocioPedia is an innovative social interaction platform that merges the dynamics of Twitter and Facebook with unique features, allowing users to engage deeply with a wide range of topics from daily activities to political debates. This cross-platform application, developed using Flask and SQL, enables users to create specialized groups such as family, friends, or acquaintances. Within these groups, users can initiate polls and discussions, posing questions on any subject. Privacy settings allow users to control visibility and anonymity of the votes and discussions, tailoring the experience to the privacy needs of each group.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Key features include:</strong>
